2020-10-27 - v1.3.4/v1.3.5/v1.3.6

2019-09-29 - v1.3.3

* Fixed bug causing failed warden responses on some servers which send warden check requests containing null byte.

2019-06-01 - v1.3.2
+ Improved Discord tag matching heuristics:
  + If multiple matches are found, preferred matches are chosen if the match is exact, or if the match contains the tag as an independent word.
  + If a picked match cannot be found, the bot will send the message as is without resolving the tag.
    In addition to whispering the sender, it will also write the error into the Discord channel, since a lot of servers block
    level 1 characters from whispering.
* Fixed bot breaking on WotLK/Cata when receiving very large responses such as the guild roster for a 900+ member guild.
* Fixed incorrect application of escaping markdown before applying config-based message formatting.

  This is advantageous to use over name, so you need not change bot configuration when a channel name is changed.
